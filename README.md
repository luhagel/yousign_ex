# Yousign

A very thin wrapper around the yousign.fr API. Currently limited in scope by what is needed at my work project.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `yousign_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:yousign_ex, "~> 0.1.2"}
  ]
end
```

## API Versions

The 0.1.x versions of this library are compatible with the 2.0 version of the Yousign API, while the 0.2.x versions are compatible with version 3 of the Yousign API.

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/yousign_ex>.
